Welcome to my website, my name is Armin Hadzic and I work on computer vision research. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Kentucky studying Computer Science.

## Research Interests:
Developing **deeping learning** methods to address challenges in latent information representation from multiple sources, including pointclouds images, and audio. More generally, I am interested in **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **reinforcement learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **remote sensing**, and **robotics**.
