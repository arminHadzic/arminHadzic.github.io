Welcome to my website, my name is Armin Hadzic and I work on computer vision research. I am a graduate student at the University of Kentucky studying Computer Science. Currently, I am advised by [Dr. Nathan Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs/) and work at the University of Kentucky Computer Vision laboratory.

# Research Interests:
Developing **deep learning** methods to address challenges in latent information representation from multiple sources, including point clouds images, and audio. More generally, I am interested in **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **reinforcement learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **remote sensing**, and **robotics**.
