We propose an automated process to access roadway safety using a deep convolutional neural network. Given a road segment and its street-level panorama, we can estimates a safety rating alongside many other road-level attributes, including curvature, roadside hazards, etc.

## [RasterNet: Modeling Free-Flow Speed using LiDAR and Overhead Imagery](http://www.arminhadzic.com/publications/RasterNet.html)

We propose RasterNet, a multi-modal neural network architecture that combines overhead imagery and airborne LiDAR point clouds for the task of free-flow speed estimation.
