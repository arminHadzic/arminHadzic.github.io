We propose RasterNet, a multi-modal neural network architecture that combines overhead imagery and airborne LiDAR point clouds for the task of free-flow speed estimation.

We developed a method for estimating displaced community populations from high resolution overhead imagery.

## [FARSA: Fully Automated Roadway Safety Assessment](https://www.cs.uky.edu/~wso226/2018/01/19/FARSA.html)

We propose an automated process to access roadway safety using a deep convolutional neural network. Given a road segment and its street-level panorama, we can estimates a safety rating alongside many other road-level attributes, including curvature, roadside hazards, etc.
