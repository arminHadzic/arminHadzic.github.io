[Bayesian optimization of distributed neurodynamical controller models for spatial navigation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2022.100218) [[Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00599)

My colleagues at JHU and JHUAPL are proud to announce that our journal paper Bayesian optimization of distributed neurodynamical controller models for spatial navigation has been published in the journal ARRAY. This is my first first-author journal article resulting from a collaboration between AI, Neuroscience, and Mathamatics researchers. Thank you to everyone who was involved.

[An interdisciplinary approach to high school curriculum development: Swarming Powered by Neuroscience](https://www.ieee-isec.info/day/1) [[Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05545)

We also published a best paper award winning manuscript to ISEC'22 conference paper. I appreciate having been able to participate in introducing students to Neuroscience and AI.
