[Bayesian optimization of distributed neurodynamical controller models for spatial navigation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2022.100218) [[Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00599)

My colleagues at JHU and JHUAPL and I are proud to announce that our journal paper, "Bayesian optimization of distributed neurodynamical controller models for spatial navigation" has been published in the journal ARRAY. This is my first first-author journal article, the end result of a fruitful collaboration between AI, Neuroscience, and Mathematics researchers. Thank you to everyone who was involved.
