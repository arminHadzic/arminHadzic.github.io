Handling Image and Label Resolution Mismatch in Remote Sensing (preprint coming soon)

A collaboration between DZYNE and Kitware resulted in a great paper on addressing resolution mismatch between overhead imagery and annotations. Big thanks to Scott for leading the effort and letting me be a part of the project. Thanks also to Usman for his valuable input.
