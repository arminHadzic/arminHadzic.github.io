[TARA: Training and Representation Alteration for AI Fairness and Domain Generalization](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/34/3/716/109060/TARA-Training-and-Representation-Alteration-for-AI) [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06387)

My first journal publication! In collaboration with Dr. Fady Alajaji from Queen's University, and my colleagues at JHUAPL and I published a paper on using representation alteration and adversarial debias to reduce bias in image data. Congrats to everyone involved, especially to William who lead the GAN portion of the method.
