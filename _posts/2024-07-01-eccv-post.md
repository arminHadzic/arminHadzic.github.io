[Probabilistic Image-Driven Traffic Modeling via Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05521)

Scott Workman and I had our overhead traffic modeling paper accepted at ECCV 2024. We have been working on traffic modeling problems over the past several years and are excited to share our latest contribution that leverages transformers with geo-temporal context, a probablistic loss, and a new dataset (DTS++). Check out our paper!
