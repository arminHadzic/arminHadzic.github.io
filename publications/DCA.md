We introduce a deep learning approach to perform finegrained population estimation for displacement camps using high-resolution overhead imagery. We train and evaluate our approach on drone imagery cross-referenced with population data for refugee camps in Coxâ€™s Bazar, Bangladesh in 2018 and 2019. Our proposed approach achieves 7.41% mean absolute percent error on sequestered camp imagery. We believe our experiments with real-world displacement camp data constitute an important step towards the development of tools that enable the humanitarian community to effectively and rapidly respond to the global displacement crisis.
